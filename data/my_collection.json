You know: lawyers. They tell us that we could get sued if there is something wrong with your copy of this etext, even if what's wrong is not our fault, and even if you got it for free and from someone other than us.  So, among other things, this \"small print\" statement disclaims most of the liability we could have to you if some- thing is wrong with your copy.  This \"small print\" statement also tells you how to distribute copies of this etext if you want to.  As explained in greater detail below, if you distribute such copies you may be required to pay us if you distribute using our trademark, and if we get sued in connection with your distribution.  *BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT  By using or reading any part of the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext that follows this statement, you indicate that you agree to and accept the following terms, conditions and disclaimers.  If you do not understand them, or do not agree to and accept them, then [1] you may not read or use the etext, and [2] you will receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it on request within 30 days of receiving it.  If you received this etext on a physical medium (such as a disk), you must return the physical medium with your request and retain no copies of it.  ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS  This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etexts, is a \"Public Domain\" work distributed by Professor Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association (the \"Project\").  Among other things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission and without paying royalties.  Special rules, set forth below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext under the Project's \"PROJECT GUTENBERG\" trademark.  To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain works. Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any medium they may be on may contain errors and defects (collectively, the \"Defects\").  Among other things, such Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription errors, unauthorized distribution of a work that is not in the public domain, a defective or damaged disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.  DISCLAIMER  As to every real and alleged Defect in this etext and any medium it may be on, and but for the \"Right of Replacement or Refund\" described below, [1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) dis- claims all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLI- GENCE OR UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND  If you received this etext in a physical medium, and the medium was physically damaged when you received it, you may return it within 90 days of receiving it to the person from whom you received it with a note explaining such Defects.  Such person will give you, in his or its discretion, a replacement copy of the etext or a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it.  If you received it electronically and it is incomplete, inaccu- rate or corrupt, you may send notice within 90 days of receiving it to the person from whom you received it describing such Defects.  Such person will give you, in his or its discretion, a second opportunity to receive it electronically, or a refund of the money (if any) you paid to receive it.  Aside from this limited warranty, THIS ETEXT IS PROVIDED TO YOU \"AS-IS\".  NO OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the above disclaimers, exclusions and limitations may not apply to you.  This \"small print\" statement gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights.  IF YOU DISTRIBUTE THIS ETEXT  You agree that if you distribute this etext or a copy of it to anyone, you will indemnify and hold the Project, its officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost and ex- pense, including legal fees, that arise by reason of your distribution and either a Defect in the etext, or any alter- ation, modification or addition to the etext by you or for which you are responsible.  This provision applies to every distribu- tion of this etext by you, whether or not for profit or under the \"PROJECT GUTENBERG\" trademark.  DISTRIBUTION UNDER \"PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm\"  You agree that if you distribute one or more copies of this etext under the \"PROJECT GUTENBERG\" trademark (whether electron- ically, or by disk, book or any other medium), you will:  [1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this re-      quires that you do not remove, alter or modify the etext or      this \"small print!\" statement.  You may however, if you      wish, distribute this etext in machine readable binary,      compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form, including any      form resulting from conversion by word processing or hyper-      text software, but only so long as *EITHER*:       [*]  The etext, when displayed, is clearly readable.  We           consider an etext *not* clearly readable if it           contains characters other than those intended by the           author of the work, although tilde (~), asterisk (*)           and underline (_) characters may be used to convey           punctuation intended by the author, and additional           characters may be used to indicate hypertext links.       [*]  The etext may be readily converted by the reader at no           expense into in plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent form           by the program that displays the etext (as is the           case, for instance, with most word processors).       [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at no           additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the etext           in its original plain ASCII form (or in EBCDIC or           other equivalent proprietary form).  [2]  Honor the terms and conditions applicable to distributors      under the \"RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND\" set forth above.  [3]  Pay a trademark license fee of 20% (twenty percent) of the      net profits you derive from distributing this etext under      the trademark, determined in accordance with generally      accepted accounting practices.  The license fee:       [*]  Is required only if you derive such profits.  In           distributing under our trademark, you incur no           obligation to charge money or earn profits for your           distribution.       [*]  Shall be paid to \"Project Gutenberg Association /           Illinois Benedictine College\" (or to such other person           as the Project Gutenberg Association may direct)           within the 60 days following each date you prepare (or           were legally required to prepare) your year-end           federal income tax return with respect to your profits           for that year.  WHAT IF YOU *WANT* TO SEND MONEY EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO?  The Project gratefully accepts contributions in money, time, scanning machines, OCR software, public domain etexts, royalty free copyright licenses, and every other sort of contribution you can think of.  Money should be paid to \"Project Gutenberg Association / Illinois Benedictine College\".  Drafted by CHARLES B.
