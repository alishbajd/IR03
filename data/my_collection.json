Why don't you\ncome down too?\"  The Goat thought well of this advice, and jumped\ndown into the well.  But the Fox immediately jumped on her back,\nand by putting his foot on her long horns managed to jump up to\nthe edge of the well.  \"Good-bye, friend,\" said the Fox, \"remember\nnext time,\n\n\"Never trust the advice of a man in difficulties.\"\n\n", "terms": ["unlucky", "chance", "Fox", "fell", "deep", "Goat", "passed", "shortly", "asked", "Fox", "heard", "Fox", "great", "drought", "jumped", "order", "water", "dont", "Goat", "thought", "advice", "jumped", "Fox", "immediately", "jumped", "back", "putting", "foot", "long", "horns", "managed", "jump", "edge", "Goodbye", "friend", "Fox", "remember", "time", "trust", "advice", "man", "difficulties", "Fox", "Goat"], "filtered_terms": [], "stemmed_terms": ["unlucki", "ch", "fox", "fell", "deep", "go", "pass", "shortli", "ask", "fox", "heard", "fox", "gr", "drought", "jump", "ord", "wat", "dont", "go", "thought", "advice", "jump", "fox", "immediat", "jump", "back", "putt", "foot", "long", "horn", "manag", "jump", "edge", "goodbye", "friend", "fox", "rememb", "time", "trust", "advice", "man", "difficulti", "fox", "go"]}]
